    <!--If you are looking for the actualy index it is in the folder below.-->

    <!--Basically, because I lack foresight, I made index not inside the root file, and put it in a folder, 
    this means I have to reroute through a fake index to get to the page I want to be at. I understand what I did wrong here
    and I will be cautious not to make the same mistake again-->
